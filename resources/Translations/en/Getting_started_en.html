<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to OmniBoard Studio!</p>
<p>The goal of this application is to help you learn the basics of programming and electronics using a visual programming interface.
    I hope that this application will help you get started with programming and electronics and inspire you to create your own projects and program via classical programming.
    Currently, the application is in its early stages of development, and I am working hard to add more features and improve the user experience.
    You can use the few exercises that that are currently available or create your own projects and programs.
    More exercises and features will be added in the future, so stay tuned!
</p>
<h3>Current features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ability to use any RPI from microcontrolers like RPI pico to linux based RPIs like RPI 4 B+</li>
    <li>Few exercises and tutorials</li>
    <li>Basic LED control</li>
    <li>PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control</li>
    <li>Basic button control</li>
    <li>Math operations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>More exercises and tutorials from the basic to more advanced projects that you can use in real life applications</li>
    <li>Advanced LED control (stuf like LED paterns)</li>
    <li>7 segment display control also with paterns for letters and numbers with the option to make your own patterns that u can save for future use</li>
    <li>Ability to control servo and DC motors, buzzers</li>
    <li>Use of sensors like photoresistors, temperature sensors and rotary encoders</li>
    <li>Even more advanced features for controlling various hardware components</li>
    <li>And much more...</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use the application:</h3>
<p>When you open the application, you will see a main canvas where you can add and connect blocks to create your program. You can also use the sidebar to manage variables, devices, and internal components. To run your program, click the "Compile and Upload" button in the toolbar. The application will generate code for your Raspberry Pi and upload it to the device.</p>
<p>You will need to set up your Raspberry Pi with the correct configuration in the settings menu before running any programs.</p>
<p>If you have any linux based RPI you will need to plug it into any power source and ensure it is connected on the same network as your computer. Then enter your RPI´s username and password in the settings menu. This will allow the application to connect to the RPI and establish communication.</p>
<p>If you have any RPI that has pico in its name (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico), make sure it is properly connected via USB to your computer. Make sure that the model is correctly selected in the settings menu.</p>
<p>For more detailed information, about setup of your Raspberry Pi, please refer to the tutorials section in this application.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the application and experiment with different blocks and configurations. If you have any questions or need help, please refer to the documentation or contact me and I will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues or errors while using the application, please report them to me so we can improve the application for future users.</p>
