<p>Goal is to demonstrate different LED patterns and timings.</p>
<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Any Raspberry Pi board</li>
    <li>USB cable to connect the board to your computer</li>
    <li>3x Any LED (different colors recommended)</li>
    <li>3x 220 Ohm resistor</li>
    <li>Breadboard and jumper wires</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wiring Diagram:</h2>
<p>(Wiring diagram image would go here)</p>
<h2>How to make it work:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Create new varibles by clicking the "Variables" button in the main window toolbar.<br>Name them <span class="highlight">however u want</span> and set their type to <span class="highlight">Boolean</span>.</li>
    <li>Create new devices by clicking the "Devices" button in the main window toolbar.<br>Name them <span class="highlight">LED1</span>, <span class="highlight">LED2</span>, and <span class="highlight">LED3</span> for convenience and set their type to <span class="highlight">Output</span>.<li>
    <li>Add the required elements to the canvas as described in the previous examples.</li>
    <li>Connect the elements to create different LED patterns with varying timings.</li>
</ol>
