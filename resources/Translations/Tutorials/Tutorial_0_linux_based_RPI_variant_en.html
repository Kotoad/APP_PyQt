<h1>Setting up a Linux-based Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up a Linux-based Raspberry Pi for use with OmniBoard Studio.</p>
<h2>RPI models:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 5</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 2 Model B</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 1 Model B</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 1 Model A</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W*</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH*</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero W*</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
</ul>
<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A compatible Raspberry Pi board (see list above)</li>
    <li>MicroSD card, at least 8GB but 32GB+ Class 10 recommended</li>
    <li>Power supply for your Raspberry Pi (any ordinary 5V USB power supply will do)</li>
    <li>HDMI cable and monitor (optional, for initial setup). <strong>You will need micro HDMI reduction adapter for some models.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps to set up your Raspberry Pi:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager for easier setup. Link: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/</a>.</li>
    <li>Insert your MicroSD card into your computer and launch Raspberry Pi Imager.</li>
    <li>Select your RPI model and the desired OS (recommended: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit. You can select lite but you will lose the ability to use the GUI of you RPI whith is not realy beginer friendly).</li>
    <li>Select your MicroSD card as the target storage.</li>
    <li>Click "Next" and enter desired Hostname (Name of your RPI), Username (login username) and Password (login password). <strong>Make sure to remember your username and password!</strong></li>
    <li>Enter your WiFi network name and password. You can add new networks later in the RPI settings via GUI or SSH.</li>
    <li>Select time zone and keyboard layout.</li>
    <li><strong>Enable SSH and VNC if you want to use remote access features.</strong></li>
    <li>Click "Write" to start writing the image to your MicroSD card. <strong> NOTE: This will wipe all data on the MicroSD card!</strong></li>
    <li>When the writing is complete, safely eject the MicroSD card from your computer and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Power on your Raspberry Pi and connect keyboard and mouse (if you are using a GUI).</li>
    <li>First time configuration and connection<ul>
        <li>If using GUI, enter your username and password to log in. Then open Terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).</li>
        <li>If using SSH, find your RPI's IP address in your router's admin panel or via a tool like nmap, then connect using SSH client (e.g., PuTTY on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux). Command: `ssh username@ip_address`. Then type yes and enter your password. Now you are in the RPI's command line interface.</li>
        <li>Run commands to update your system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y`</li>
        <li>If you are using GUI, you can use RealVNC Viewer to connect to your RPI's desktop environment. NOTE: You must enable VNC in the RPI settings (Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > VNC).</li>
        <li>Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply all changes using `sudo reboot`.</li>
    </ul></li>
