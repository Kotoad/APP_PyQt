## 🎯 YOUR IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### Phase 1: Week 1 (6-8 hours)
Implement these in code_compiler.py:

1. ✅ `handle_for_block()` ← Snippet 1
2. ✅ `handle_set_variable_block()` ← Snippet 2
3. ✅ `handle_math_operation_block()` ← Snippet 3
4. ✅ `handle_print_block()` ← Snippet 4
5. ✅ `handle_analog_read_block()` ← Snippet 5
6. ✅ `handle_pwm_write_block()` ← Snippet 6
7. ✅ Update `process_block()` ← Snippet 7
8. ✅ Add `validate_project()` ← Snippet 8

Then test with simple programs (Print, For, Math blocks)

### Phase 2: Week 2 (6-8 hours)
1. ✅ Test on Pico W hardware
2. ✅ Test on RPi with GPIO
3. ✅ Fix any hardware issues
4. ✅ Add better error messages

### Result:
✅ **Working MVP in 2 weeks!**

## 📞 QUICK REFERENCE

**Question: Where do I put the code?**
Answer: code_compiler.py, after existing handlers

**Question: How many functions do I need to add?**
Answer: 6 main ones + some helpers = ~16 total

**Question: How long will it take?**
Answer: ~30 min per function = 3-4 hours total

**Question: How do I test?**
Answer: Create simple program in GUI, click Compile, check File.py

**Question: What if something breaks?**
Answer: See implementation_guide.md → "IF YOU GET STUCK"

**Question: Can I test without hardware?**
Answer: Yes! Check generated File.py for syntax errors first
